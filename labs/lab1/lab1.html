    <h6> by Emanuel Morrison</h6>
    <p> My name is Emanuel Morrison and I was born on Feb 3 2006. I was born in Jamaca hospitle . I graduated from Hawtree creek Middle school during the summer of the pandemic. I'm here because I applied to be in the visual arts program at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School and I stupidly though that digital arts ment that we draw on labtops. I plan to keep my grades high and to make the most out of my years in high school. I hope to become a primatoligest, since I know some facts about primates.Also I love rock(the music genre). :)</p>
